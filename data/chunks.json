( see list of coups and coup attempts by country and list of civil wars. ) examples include the spanish civil war, the coup of 18 brumaire that ended the french first republic, and the 28 may 1926 coup d ' etat which ended the first portuguese republic. some military coups are supported by foreign governments, such as the 1954 guatemalan coup d ' etat and the 1953 iranian coup d ' etat. other types of a sudden end to democracy include : democratic backsliding can end democracy in a gradual manner, by increasing emphasis on national security and eroding free and fair elections, freedom of expression, independence of the judiciary, rule of law. a famous example is the enabling act of 1933, which lawfully ended democracy in weimar germany and marked the transition to nazi germany. temporary or long - term political violence and government interference can prevent free and fair elections, which erode the democratic nature of governments. this has happened on a local level even in well - established democracies like the united states ; for example, the wilmington insurrection of 1898 and african - american disfranchisement after the reconstruction era. the theory of democracy relies on the implicit assumption that voters are well informed about social issues, policies, and candidates so that they can make a truly informed decision. since the late 20th century there has been a growing concern that voters may be poorly informed due to the news media ' s focusing more on entertainment and gossip and less on serious",

    "text": "problem. some researchers have attempted a unifying monistic definition of species, while others adopt a pluralistic approach and suggest that there may be different ways to logically interpret the definition of a species. barriers to reproduction between two diverging sexual populations are required for the populations to become new species. gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations. depending on how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor, it may still be possible for them to produce offspring, as with horses and donkeys mating to produce mules. such hybrids are generally infertile. in this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct. however, viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent species, or possess a totally new phenotype. the importance of hybridisation in producing new species of animals is unclear, although cases have been seen in many types of animals, with the grey tree frog being a particularly well - studied example. speciation has been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature. in sexually reproducing organisms, speciation results from reproductive isolation followed by genealogical divergence. there are four primary geographic modes of speciation. the most common in animals is allopatric speciation, which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by habitat fragmentation or migration. selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms. as selection and drift act independently on populations isolated from the rest of their species, separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot interbreed. the second mode of speciation is peripatric speciation, which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment. this differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population. here, the founder effect causes rapid speciation after an increase in",

( the latter process was later called lamarckism. ) these ideas were condemned by established naturalists as speculation lacking empirical support. in particular, georges cuvier insisted that species were unrelated and fixed, their similarities reflecting divine design for functional needs. in the meantime, ray ' s ideas of benevolent design had been developed by william paley into the natural theology or evidences of the existence and attributes of the deity ( 1802 ), which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design and which was admired by charles darwin. the crucial break from the concept of constant typological classes or types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection, which was formulated by charles darwin and alfred wallace in terms of variable populations. darwin used the expression descent with",

( see also [ non - coding dna ]. ) a gene is a sequence of dna that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. within a gene, the sequence of bases along a dna strand defines a messenger rna sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. the relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino - acid sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. the genetic code consists of three - letter ' words ' called codons formed from a sequence of three nucleotides ( e. g., act, cag, ttt ). in transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger rna by rna polymerase. this rna copy is then decoded by a ribosome that reads the rna sequence by base - pairing the messenger rna to transfer rna, which carries amino acids. since there are 4 bases",

    "text": "a suzerain (, from old french \" above \" + \" supreme, chief \" ) is a person, state or polity who has supremacy and dominant influence over the foreign policy and economic relations of another subordinate party or polity, but allows internal autonomy to that subordinate. where the subordinate polity is called a vassal, vassal state or tributary state, the dominant party is called the suzerain. the rights and obligations of a vassal are called vassalage, and the rights and obligations of a suzerain are called suzerainty. suzerainty differs from sovereignty in that the dominant power does not exercise centralized governance over the vassals, allowing tributary states to be technically self - ruling but enjoy only limited independence. although the situation has existed in a number of historical empires, it is considered difficult to reconcile with 20th - or 21st - century concepts of international law, in which sovereignty is a binary concept, which either exists or does not. while a sovereign state can agree by treaty to become a protectorate of a stronger power, modern international law does not recognise any way of making this relationship compulsory on the weaker power. suzerainty is a practical, de facto situation, rather than a legal, de jure one. current examples include bhutan and india. india is responsible for military training, arms supplies, and the air defense of bhutan. in early ancient china, the various self - ruling regional polities ( some being merely tribal city - states ) often align under the sphere of influence of a confederacy, of which the largest, most powerful state typically became the de jure dynastic leader. during the era of the mythical three sovereigns and five emperors dynastic and the subsequent theocratic xia and shang dynasties, such a suzerain state would assume the \" divine blessings \" of mandate of heaven and became known as an overlord ( chinese : ; pinyin : ; lit.

    "text": "the timed up and go test ( tug ) is a simple test used to assess a person ' s mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. it uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around 180 degrees, walk back to the chair, and sit down while turning 180 degrees. during the test, the person is expected to wear their regular footwear and use any mobility aids that they would normally require. the tug is used frequently in the elderly population, as it is easy to administer and can generally be completed by most older adults. one source suggests that scores of ten seconds or less indicate normal mobility, 11 \u2013 20 seconds are within normal limits for frail elderly and disabled patients, and greater than 20 seconds means the person needs assistance outside and indicates further examination and intervention. a score of 30 seconds or more suggests that the person may be prone to falls. alternatively, a recommended practical cut - off value for the tug to indicate normal versus below normal performance is 12 seconds. a study by bischoff et al. showed the 10th to 90th percentiles for tug performance were 6. 0 to 11. 2 seconds for community - dwelling women between 65 and 85 years of age, and determined that this population should be able to perform the tug in 12 seconds or less. tug performance has been found to decrease significantly with mobility impairments. residential status and physical mobility status have been determined to be significant predictors of tug performance. the tug was developed from a more comprehensive test, the get - up and go test. research has shown the timed up and go test has excellent interrater ( intraclass correlation coefficient [ icc ] =. 99 ) and intrarater reliability ( icc =. 99 ). the test score also correlates well with gait speed ( r = -. 55 ), scores on the berg balance scale ( r = -. 72 ), and the barthel index ( r = -. 51 ). many",

    "text": "artwashing is a term used to describe the use of artistic and creative practices in ways that have been associated with processes of gentrification. in academic literature, the term has been used to refer to situations in which art is employed to make locations more amenable to private capital and to the aesthetics favored by higher - income groups. the term is also widely used by activists, who argue that by promoting narratives of \u201c creativity \u201d and \u201c coolness, \u201d artistic activity can function as a form of symbolic capital that contributes to the rebranding of devalued or industrial neighborhoods, a process they associate with the displacement of existing low - income communities. in urban planning and development, artwashing is often described as taking the form of corporate sponsorship of temporary artworks or the creation of cultural \u201c hubs \", which are used to rebrand specific sites during periods of redevelopment. critics argue that while such initiatives may create a sense of community engagement, they frequently align with broader redevelopment strategies that do not address underlying social inequalities and may reproduce existing power imbalances rather than produce inclusive forms of neighborhood change. the term \u201c artwashing \u201d gained prominence in the mid - 2010s and was popularized by activists and journalists, most notably feargus o \u2019 sullivan, during anti - gentrification protests in the boyle heights district of los angeles. etymologically, the term is a portmanteau of the words \u201c art \u201d and \u201c whitewashing. artwashing has been discussed alongside other forms of \u201c washing, \u201d such as greenwashing, pinkwashing, and sportswashing, which are often described as practices aimed at shaping public perception and legitimacy. the conceptual roots of artwashing predate the term itself and have been linked to earlier theories on the relationship between culture and urban development, including the \u201c artistic mode of production \u201d theorized by sharon zukin in the early 1980s. this framework examines how cultural activity has been incorporated into real estate",

    "text": "pro - aging trance, also known as pro - aging edifice, is a term coined by british author and biomedical gerontologist aubrey de grey to describe the broadly positive and fatalistic attitude toward aging in society. according to de grey, the pro - aging trance explains why many people gloss over aging through irrational thought patterns. the concept says that the thought of one ' s own body slowly but ceaselessly deteriorating is so burdensome that it seems most sensible from a psychological point of view to try to put it out of one ' s mind. since aging has been present throughout human history, this coping strategy would be deeply rooted in human thinking. it is striking that, in defending their point of view, those affected often commit fallacies which, from experience, would not be expected of them in a different context. the name, according to de grey, comes from the similarity of persons affected to hypnotised people, whose subconscious minds in the trance state prefer to resort to illogical explanations rather than abandon a deeply - held belief. the pro - aging trance consists both in the belief that the aging process is inevitable and therefore will not be prevented even by future developments, and in the view that any success in the fight against aging would have mainly negative societal effects. examples cited include boredom, overpopulation, unresolved problems regarding current pension systems, and dictators living forever, but there is no nuanced and factual discussion of counter - arguments and proposed solutions and no juxtaposition or weighing of these potential disadvantages with the benefits of eliminating aging ( such as saving about 100, 000 lives per day ). de grey assumes that robust mouse rejuvenation will provide a paradigm shift in society in this regard. the phenomenon of the pro - aging trance is a hurdle in the rapid development of anti - aging medicine. the reason is that it takes time for people to break out of it and the result of lacking public support is low research funding. furthermore, aging is",
